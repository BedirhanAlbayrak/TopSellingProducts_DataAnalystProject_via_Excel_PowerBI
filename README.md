# Business Request
The business request for this data analysis project is to understand the behaviors of products on selling. At the end of the data analysis work, this project report can guide them in inventory decisions, marketing pushes, and future product development.

# Data Cleansing & Transformation (Excel)
To create the necessary data model for doing analysis tables were extracted by using Excel.

# Top Selling Products Dashboard (Power BI)
At the final of this project, I created one paged dashboard "Top Selling Products Report" which shows the key points of the business request.
